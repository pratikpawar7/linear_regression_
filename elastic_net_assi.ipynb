    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) \n",
    "and L2 (Ridge) regularization methods. It addresses the limitations of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso (L1): Shrinks coefficients and can set some to exactly zero, making it useful for feature selection\n",
    "            , but it can struggle when dealing with highly correlated features.\n",
    "Ridge (L2): Shrinks coefficients but keeps all features, preventing coefficients from going to zero,\n",
    "            and handles multicollinearity better.\n",
    "                \n",
    "Elastic Net combines these penalties to get the benefits of both:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 term (Lasso): Drives some coefficients to zero, performing feature selection.\n",
    "L2 term (Ridge): Stabilizes the solution when features are highly correlated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Difference from other techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge only applies L2 regularization.\n",
    "Lasso only applies L1 regularization.\n",
    "Elastic Net balances between L1 and L2 penalties, combining the strengths of both."
